# Imagizer: Image Processing Desktop Application

Imagizer is a desktop application built using PyQt to perform various image processing algorithms. It allows users to manipulate standard images (grayscale and color) with functionalities including noise addition, filtering, edge detection, histogram analysis, normalization, equalization, thresholding, color to grayscale conversion, frequency domain filtering, and hybrid image generation.

## Features

### 1. Additive Noise
   - Uniform Noise
   - Gaussian Noise
   - Salt and Pepper Noise


### 2. Filtering
   - Average Filter
   - Gaussian Filter
   - Median Filter

### 3. Edge Detection
   - Sobel Operator
   - Roberts Operator
   - Prewitt Operator
   - Laplace Operator
   - Canny Edge Detector

### 4. Histogram Analysis
   - Histogram Plotting
   - Distribution Curve Plotting

### 5. Equalization

### 6. Normalization

### 7. Thresholding
   - Local Thresholding
   - Global Thresholding

### 8. Color to Grayscale Conversion
   - Plotting R, G, and B histograms
   - Distribution Function Plotting

### 9. Frequency Domain Filtering
   - High Pass Filters
   - Low Pass Filters

### 10. Hybrid Images


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
